## Course Description
This is an undergraduate class on the composition of game engines, some of the most complex software applications that exist. We will discuss features common to game engines, such as memory management, rendering, and support for online play. Over the course of the semester, we will create our own game engine, with students extending it in homework assignments. An end of the semester project will be the student’s opportunity to go further in an area of their choosing.

## Course Text
No required textbooks. Game Engine Architecture by Jason Gregory is an excellent reference but will not be used directly in the course. Each lecture will include a list of optional online references.

## Learning Outcomes
Students will demonstrate how to detect and report context for memory leaks (homework 1). In homework 2, students will build thread-safe system for decompressing files are load time. Students will apply knowledge of CPUs and performance optimization to create a performance tracing system that outputs to the Chrome trace format (homework 3). Students will synthesize what they learned about graphics and entity systems to build a very simple game using their game engine (homework 4). Then in homework 5, students will extend their simple game to support network play. Finally, students will expand their game engine in a direction of their own choosing in a final project.

## Course Assessment Measures & Grading Criteria
A student’s grade will be determined by their performance on homework assignments and a final project.

A schedule of homework assignments is listed in the Class Schedule section at the end of this syllabus. Homework is due at 11:59pm on the day listed in the schedule. Homework submitted late will received a penalty; 10% per 24-hour period after the submission deadline, up to a maximum of 50%. 

Each student will propose their own final project. The instructor will approve all final projects.

| Factor        | Percentage of Grade |
|---------------|:-------------------:|
| Homework      |75% (15% each)       |
| Final Project |25%                  |

Because there are 6 homework assignments, and each is worth 15% of the overall grade, it is possible to receive a zero on one homework and still receive an A in the course.

## Attendance
Attendance is a key component of the course. Lectures will include interactive discussions and live game engine development. Students who do not regularly attend class should expect to homework assignments to be that much more challenging.

## Academic Honesty
Student-teacher relationships are built on trust. For example, students must trust that teachers have made appropriate decisions about the structure and content of the courses they teach, and teachers must trust that the assignments that students turn in are their own. Acts that violate this trust undermine the educational process. The Rensselaer Handbook of Student Rights and Responsibilities and The Graduate Student Supplement define various forms of Academic Dishonesty and you should make yourself familiar with these. In this class, all assignments that are turned in for a grade must represent the student’s own work. In cases where help was received, or teamwork was allowed, a notation on the assignment should indicate your collaboration.

Submission of any assignment that is in violation of this policy may result an F in this course. Violations of academic integrity may also be reported to the appropriate Dean (Dean of Students for undergraduate students or the Dean of Graduate Education for graduate students, respectively). If you have any question concerning this policy before submitting an assignment, please ask for clarification.
